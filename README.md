3. Ensure you have the necessary environment variables set up for cryptographic operations.

## Usage

To use SchemaPin in your project, follow these guidelines:

1. **Signing a Schema**:
   ```javascript
   const SchemaPin = require('schema-pin');

   const schema = {
       name: "AI Agent",
       version: "1.0",
       description: "An AI agent tool schema."
   };

   const signedSchema = SchemaPin.sign(schema, privateKey);
   console.log(signedSchema);
   ```

2. **Verifying a Schema**:
   ```javascript
   const isValid = SchemaPin.verify(signedSchema, publicKey);
   console.log(`Is the schema valid? ${isValid}`);
   ```
